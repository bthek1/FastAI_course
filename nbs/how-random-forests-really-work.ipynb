    "I think the first thing I'd note from this is that, clearly, more complex models aren't always better. Our \"OneR\" model, consisting of a single binary split, was nearly as good as our more complex models. Perhaps in practice a simple model like this might be much easier to use, and could be worth considering. Our random forest wasn't an improvement on the single decision tree at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we should always be careful to benchmark simple models, as see if they're good enough for our needs. In practice, you will often find that simple models will have trouble providing adequate accuracy for more complex tasks, such as recommendation systems, NLP, computer vision, or multivariate time series. But there's no need to guess -- it's so easy to try a few different models, there's no reason not to give the simpler ones a go too!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing I think we can take away is that random forests aren't actually that complicated at all. We were able to implement the key features of them in a notebook quite quickly. And they aren't sensitive to issues like normalization, interactions, or non-linear transformations, which make them extremely easy to work with, and hard to mess up!"
